# go game module

This module aims to rebuild the AI taken from the book [Deep Learning and the Game of Go](https://www.manning.com/books/deep-learning-and-the-game-of-go)
with the programming language Julia (instead of Python).

Containing:
 - random bot: to play against only randomized  movements (manvbot.jl or botvbot.jl)
 - MCTS bot: to generate Monte Carlo based moves, used as training data (generate_mcts_games.jl)
 

 Next step first deep learning
